    <preparation>
      <li>Drain tofu and place the block on a plate. Cover with another plate and weight the top with a food can or other object of about 1 pound. Let stand 20 to 30 minutes to extract excess liquid. Pour off liquid. Crumble tofu and place it in a bowl. Sprinkle with flour, yeast, onion powder, garlic powder and turmeric and toss. Sprinkle with liquid aminos and toss again. </li>
      <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or nonstick pan over medium heat until hot. Add tofu mixture and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan frequently with a spatula to prevent sticking, until tofu is browned and crisp in places. Serve with the warmed tortillas, salsa and toppings of choice and let diners assemble their own tacos. </li>
